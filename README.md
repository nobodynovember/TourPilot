# TourPilot
In this work, we presents TourPilot, an innovative indoor tour guidance system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that integrates pathfinding, adaptive tour planning, and real-time navigation into a unified autonomous framework. To support LLM-driven spatial reasoning, TourPilot introduces an Indoor Entity Graph, which encodes semantic entities and spatial relationships in complex environments. Based on this, we propose a State-Driven Dynamic Planning framework that generates personalized tour plans in real time. For execution, we develop a Narrated Tour Vision-and-Language Navigation method, enabling the LLM to interpret multimodal inputs and perform navigation and tour narration without infrastructure-based positioning. The system uses instruction tuning to align LLM behavior with tour guidance functions, delivering performance comparable to that of human guides. We validate TourPilot in three real-world scenarios: CF Market Mall, Studio Bell Museum, and an art studio. A quantitative user study evaluates TourPilotâ€™s performance across standard LLM system metrics, highlighting its potential as a next-generation solution for indoor tour guidance. 

This repository provides the indoor navigation case in an art studio, serving as a demonstration of our method.

## Installation
1. Matterport3D installation instruction: [here](https://github.com/peteanderson80/Matterport3DSimulator). 
2. Install requirements:
```setup
conda create -n SpatialGPT python=3.10
conda activate SpatialGPT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## OpenAI API key
Fill in your API key at Line 12 of the file: GPT/api.py.

## Run TourPilot
Ensure that the PYTHONPATH environment variable includes all necessary module directories (e.g., the project root) so that Python can locate internal packages like vln module.

Then run:
```bash
bash scripts/gpt4o.sh
```
